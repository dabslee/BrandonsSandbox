<p>A few days ago, I reread <i>Demian</i> by Herman Hesse. The book is remarkably short; it's reasonable to knock it out in just four or five hours. I read it once in middle school, but all I remember from then is being very weirded out and confused by it. After reading it yesterday, I frankly remain weirded out by it, though a bit less confused.</p>

<p>I think I'll write two posts about this book—in this post, I'll jot down a synopsis of the book's main ideas and my own initial impressions, and in writing the second post, I'll do some research about the book's context and previous interpretations of it and synthesize them into my own final understanding.</p>

<p><i>Demian</i> is narratively a coming-of-age story. The book takes on the first-person-perspective of a man named Sinclair recounting his childhood. The story centers around Sinclair's process of discovering himself and his philosophy on life, with another boy, the eponymous Demian, making periodic appearances and greatly affecting Sinclair's journey. Despite the fact that Demian grows up starting at the same age and at the same pace as Sinclair, Demian is largely a very static character throughout the book; we can see Sinclair's journey as becoming more like Demian, slowly adopting his philosophies and lifestyle.</p>

<p>The philosophy in this book mainly comes in three main forms: Sinclair's inner turmoil and reflections, Demian's monologues, and a few conversations with Pistorius, who mentors Sinclair for a time. Some of these important ideas include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p><b>Challenge the orthodox and traditional; strive to establish your own interpretations of the world.</b> In his very first encounter with Sinclair, Demian opens with a challenge of the mainstream interpretation of the story of Cain and Abel, where he suggests that Cain was a powerful, superior man who was simply feared by others due to his strength. Demian continues to emphasize the importance of self-determination over blindly following established beliefs throughout the book.</p>
        <p>We also see an example of someone who fails at this in Pastorius late in the book, who Sinclair respects for his deep knowledge of history and world religions, but ultimately rejects due to his inability to leave the old behind and create something entirely new.</p>
        <p>The book, however, does not say that one must completely reject and ignore the traditional—Sinclair differentiates himself from atheists, for instance, as he believes in God and the Bible to some extent—the important thing is to interpret it in one's own way.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><b>Do not fear people.</b> Demian asserts this when talking about Sinclair's bully with him, saying, "One should never be afraid of any man." He explains, "You don’t need to be afraid of anybody. When you are afraid of someone it means you have provided that someone with some kind of lever." Thus, Demian's condemnation of fear is also based on his valuing of self-determination—when you're afraid of someone else, you give them control over you, which is antithetical to self-determination.</p> 
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><b>The world consists of both light and darkness, and we should worship both rather than just the world of light.</b> This idea is one of the first ones in the book, with Sinclair explaining that even as a little kid, he saw the world divided into a world of "light"—consisting of his high-class parents, school, church, and everything else proper—and a world of "darkness"—consisting of the unrefined servant class, crime, and later, sex.</p>
        <p>Sinclair initially finds Demian disturbing, seeing elements of the dark world in him due to Demian's heresy concerning Cain and Abel. However, Demian is better thought of as straddling both the light and dark world—indeed, it is he that first introduces Sinclair to the idea that both worlds deserve veneration. In primary school, Demian challenges the idea of the Christian God to Sinclair, stating that Jehovah is incomplete, only representing the light world. Demian argues that either we must worship the Devil as well as God, or alternatively embrace a god that is both God and the Devil. This idea is ultimately realized when Sinclair paints Abraxas, a Gnostic god who encompasses both good and evil.</p>
        <p>This idea of venerating duality expands later in the book as Sinclair paints and begins worshipping his "daimon," a reperesentation of his self and purpose. In the ideology of self-determination, this daimon is what one must worship and forever pursue. Sinclair's daimon is androgynous, and Sinclair's attitude towards it is contradictory, both loving and hating it and both seeing it as a Madonna and as a whore.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><b>There exists people who are special in this world, who strive to and are able to pursue self-discovery over all else. These people bear the "Mark of Cain" are feared by others and will be the ones to establish a new world order when the old order inevitably collapses.</b> Demian, Eva, and Sinclair believe at the end of the book that they are a select few people who bear the "Mark of Cain," setting them apart from most people. Those who bear the mark subscribe to their philosophies of self-determination and embracing duality and have the power to create.</p>
        <p>The three of them believe that the world is currently defective, with people chained to old ideas and unable to think freely and individually. They believe the world will encounter some incredible catastrophe (later implied to be World War I), and that afterwards, those bearing the mark will be the ones to rebuild a better world.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><b>The power of one's will.</b> There seems to be some kind of supernatural power associated with directing one's will towards something. By focusing their will on some goal, it seems that Demian, Sinclair, and presumably Eva can bend reality towards that goal.</p>
        <p>This phenomenon occurs first early in the book, most notably with Demian changing seats to sit with Sinclair despite having been assigned to sit separately. Demian explains that he first directed his will towards not sitting in the front, where he was assigned, and that a kid nearer to the back subsequently got sick and had to leave, allowing Demian to take his seat. Then, Demian, now sitting near Sinclair, realized that he really wanted to sit next to him; Demian then simply took the seat next to Sinclair, and the student originally sitting there just took Demian's seat when he realized Demian had taken his. In this case, the phenomenon seems explainable without the supernatural—Demian, by focusing his will, simply made himself ready to act when an opportunity arised to change seats.</p>
        <p>However, the phenomenon later takes a more distincly supernatural turn. Sinclair, for example, by directing his will towards contacting Eva from far away, was able to transmit his desire and get Eva to send Demian to see him.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some initial impressions I have:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p><b>The supernatural elements.</b> The book has an array of strange phenomena, usually related to Demian. Demian has uncanny abilities, seemingly able to read minds and control them to some extent. He states that "There’s no black magic about it but if you don’t know how it is done it seems uncanny" and tries to offer scientific explanations—for instance, he explains his desk moving in terms of his will making him ready to seize opportunities, and he explains his mind reading by simply being able to read people's expressions and behaviors extremely well. He also says that he cannot do the impossible, and that anything he does must be realistically possible. However, there are many instances where he does things that should be impossible, such as transmitting feelings across long distances.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><b>The role of sex.</b> Though there is no explicit depictions or in-depth discussions of sex, sexual tension permeates the story. Personally, Sinclair seems to be in a constant state of sexual frustration and eventually becomes a sexual deviant (by my and the outside world's standards) who lusts after his friend Demian's mother, Eva. It's overall a very weird story, and I'd be interested in exploring this weirdness.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><b>Manifestation.</b> One of the reasons I read this book was because the recent trend on social media where people believe in "manifestation"—that is, the New Thought ideology that people can bend reality to their desires by focusing their wills towards them—reminded me of Demian's powers in this book. I'd be interested in exploring the relationship between <i>Demian</i>, the author Herman Hesse, and the New Thought movement.</p>
